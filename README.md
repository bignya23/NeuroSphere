Neurodiversity, a fundamental dimension of human diversity, encompasses a range of neurological differences such as autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and other cognitive variations. Despite its importance, awareness about neurodiversity remains low in many parts of the world, leading to stigma, discrimination, and a lack of support for neurodiverse individuals. Many neurodiverse people face significant barriers in education, employment, and daily life, preventing them from living independently and reaching their full potential. The absence of accessible solutions tailored to their unique needs further exacerbates these challenges, highlighting the urgent need for innovative, technology-driven approaches to create a more inclusive world.
